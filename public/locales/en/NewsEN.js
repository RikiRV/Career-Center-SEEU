      '“SEEU each year drafts the employability report, which is sent to all institutions in the country, a practice that other universities in the country and in the region don’t have. According to this report, 65% of graduates, in a period of 6 months after graduation, are employed, and if we add to this figure about 20% of those who willingly do not seek work, as they have different career goals, then the employability of our graduates reaches 83%. What is very important and what distinguishes the University is that about 70% of the total number of employees belongs to the private sector" noted Rector Bexheti.',
